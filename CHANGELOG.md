## [Unreleased]

## 2026-01-16

- [prompt-engineering] v1.15.0 - Execution Discipline preservation category:
  - New distinction: trust model's KNOWLEDGE (drop), don't trust model's DISCIPLINE (keep)
  - Execution discipline = guardrails against laziness, premature completion, context loss, skipping verification
  - Priority 2 alongside Novel Constraints in preservation hierarchy
  - Examples: "write findings BEFORE proceeding", "don't finalize until X verified", "read full log before synthesis"
  - Verifier updated to NOT flag execution discipline as over-specification
  - Key insight: discipline guardrails address model weaknesses, not capability gaps
- [prompt-engineering] v1.14.0 - Trust-the-model compression philosophy:
  - Shift from "semantic preservation" to "capability preservation"
  - New preservation hierarchy: goal + novel constraints only; drop training-redundant content
  - Training filter: "Would a competent person doing this task need to be told this?" If no → drop
  - Action Space Check: verify model is FREE to solve its own way
  - Verifier now flags Over-Specification (recommend removal) and Training-Redundant content
  - New severity model: MEDIUM/LOW issues are about REMOVING content, not adding it back
  - Target even more aggressive compression by trusting model's training
  - Domain-agnostic: works for any prompt type (coding, decisions, writing, research)
- [prompt-engineering] v1.13.0 - Fix compress-prompt to enforce aggressive compression:
  - Explicit target: 85-95% token reduction, ~200-600 tokens max output
  - Clarified output must be ONE dense paragraph (no headers, bullets, structure)
  - Added self-check before writing: is it one paragraph? ~200-600 tokens?
  - New "Common Mistakes to Avoid" section (reformatting vs compressing)
  - Clearer preservation hierarchy table with KEEP vs DROP actions
- [prompt-engineering] v1.12.0 - New `/compress-prompt` skill for extreme prompt compression:
  - Compresses prompts/skills into single dense paragraphs for AI-readable context injection
  - 7-level preservation hierarchy (goal/constraints NEVER drop; explanations/style CAN drop)
  - Natural dense prose compression (semicolon-chained, articles omitted, abbreviations used)
  - New `prompt-compression-verifier` agent checks 5 issue types (Missing Core Goal, Missing Constraint, Missing Edge Case, Semantic Drift, Ambiguity Introduced)
  - Non-destructive output (display + optional file save)
  - Verification loop with max 5 iterations
- [prompt-engineering] v1.11.3 - Use `mv` for atomic file replacement in all optimization skills:
  - `/apply-prompt-feedback`, `/optimize-prompt-goal`, `/optimize-prompt-precision` now use `mv` instead of Write tool for final output
  - Matches existing pattern in `/optimize-prompt-token-efficiency`
- [prompt-engineering] v1.11.2 - Comparison mode for `/optimize-prompt-precision`:
  - `prompt-precision-verifier` now supports comparison mode (original vs modified)
  - Adds 2 comparison-mode issue types: Optimization Regression, Over-Optimization
  - `/optimize-prompt-precision` uses comparison mode for post-optimization verification
- [prompt-engineering] v1.11.1 - Verifier comparison mode for regression detection:
  - `prompt-goal-verifier` now supports comparison mode (original vs modified)
  - Adds 2 comparison-mode issue types: Optimization Regression, Over-Optimization
  - `/optimize-prompt-goal` uses comparison mode for post-optimization verification
  - `/apply-prompt-feedback` verifier compares original vs modified to detect regressions
- [prompt-engineering] v1.11.0 - New `/apply-prompt-feedback` skill for calibrated feedback application:
  - Applies user feedback to prompts without over-fitting or causing regressions
  - New `prompt-feedback-verifier` agent checks 6 issue types across 3 dimensions:
    - Incorporation (2): Feedback Not Addressed, Partial Incorporation
    - Calibration (2): Over-Fitting, Over-Specification
    - Preservation (2): Regression, Information Density Loss
  - Apply-first approach: applies feedback, then verifies for issues
  - Information density maximization: minimal text to achieve change
  - Iterative refinement loop (max 5 iterations) driven by verifier feedback
- [prompt-engineering] v1.10.0 - New `/optimize-prompt-token-efficiency` skill (moved from vibe-extras):
  - Iteratively optimizes prompts for token efficiency while preserving semantic content
  - Verify-first approach: runs verifier before changes, exits early if already efficient
  - New `prompt-token-efficiency-verifier` agent with dual-mode operation:
    - Single-file mode: identifies inefficiencies (redundancy, verbosity, compression opportunities)
    - Two-file mode: verifies compression is lossless by comparing original vs compressed
  - Techniques: redundancy removal, terse phrasing, filler elimination, structural optimization
- [vibe-extras] v1.6.0 - Removed `maximize-info-density` skill (moved to prompt-engineering as `/optimize-prompt-token-efficiency`)
- [prompt-engineering] v1.9.0 - Verify-first approach and rename `/refine-prompt` → `/optimize-prompt-precision`:
  - Rename: `/refine-prompt` → `/optimize-prompt-precision` for consistency with `/optimize-prompt-goal`
  - Run verifier FIRST before any changes - maybe prompt is already optimal
  - All changes driven by verifier feedback only - no independent analysis
  - Early exit if verifier returns VERIFIED on first check

  - Updated todo list template to split option discovery into "ask user first" + "research" steps
- [life-ops] v1.4.0 - Research-validated improvements to `/decide` skill:
  - Add gut check phase: captures intuition as data before analysis (research shows emotion is essential, not enemy, of good decisions)
  - Reposition 10-10-10 as "Temporal Perspective Check": theoretically grounded in Construal Level Theory (no direct empirical validation exists for 10-10-10 specifically)
