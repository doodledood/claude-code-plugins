Use the design-guidelines skill to craft a DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md document for the user.

Start with Phase 0: Prerequisite check for CUSTOMER.md.

Key points:
- CUSTOMER.md is a MUST - stop if not found
- **Launch opus agent (Phase 1)** to deeply analyze CUSTOMER.md and understand ideal design direction BEFORE asking questions
- Pre-fill ALL recommendations based on opus agent analysis
- Bake in anti-AI-slop principles from frontend-design skill
- Generate distinctive design system, not generic templates
- Test with sample components before finalizing
