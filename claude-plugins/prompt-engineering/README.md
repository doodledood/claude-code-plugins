# Prompt Engineering

Analyze prompts against structured frameworks.

## What It Does

Run `/review-prompt` to analyze a prompt file against the 10-Layer Architecture framework. Identifies genuine improvement opportunities—gaps in context, unclear instructions, missing constraints.

Reports only. Does not modify files.

## Components

- `/review-prompt` - Analyze a prompt file
- `prompt-reviewer` agent - Deep analysis for automated reviews

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/doodledood/claude-code-plugins
