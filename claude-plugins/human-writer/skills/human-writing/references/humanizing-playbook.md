# Humanizing Playbook: Making AI-Assisted Writing Feel Human

Actionable techniques for making AI-assisted writing feel authentically human -- from post-generation editing to deep craft development.

## The Four-Layer Editing System

The most effective approach operates at four levels, from surface to substance. Apply in order.

### Layer 1: Word-Level

Maintain a blacklist of AI-tell vocabulary and search-replace or delete on sight.

**Kill list** (non-exhaustive):
- **Verbs**: delve, embark, endeavor, leverage, harness, navigate (metaphorical), unlock, foster, catalyze, bolster, underscore, showcase, elucidate
- **Adjectives**: seamless, robust, groundbreaking, transformative, pivotal, vibrant, compelling, crucial, invaluable, holistic, multifaceted, meticulous, commendable
- **Adverbs**: seamlessly, meticulously, notably, profoundly, predominantly, subsequently, thereby
- **Stock phrases**: "ever-evolving landscape," "in today's fast-paced world," "as we navigate the complexities," "It isn't just X, it's Y," "it's important to note," "it's worth noting that"

**Adjective audit**: Strip all adjectives from a paragraph, then restore only those carrying concrete information. "Robust system" becomes "handles 10k req/s without data loss."

### Layer 2: Sentence-Level

Read only the first few words of consecutive sentences. Wherever three or more follow the same pattern (same word, same structure), cut or combine.

**Vary sentence length deliberately**: Short sentences for punch and emphasis. Longer ones for nuance and reflection. The contrast creates impact -- "any word next to the period says, 'Look at me'" (Roy Peter Clark).

**Add intentional imperfection**: Break a fragment on purpose. Insert a casual aside. Use a sentence that sounds like how you actually talk. Replace formal constructions ("leveraging AI") with conversational phrasing.

### Layer 3: Structural

**Eliminate meta-commentary**: "In this section, we will..." adds nothing. Delete it.

**Kill recap conclusions**: Delete final paragraphs that only repeat earlier points. Replace "In conclusion..." with one specific closing sentence or, better, just end when you're done.

**Break pattern symmetry**: Demote repetitive subheadings into plain paragraphs. Merge overlapping sections. Ensure each paragraph's opening line differs structurally from the one before it.

### Layer 4: Content (This Is Where It Matters)

**Add lived experience**: Personal anecdotes, firsthand observations, specific failures. Replace generic claims ("improves results") with specific details -- what the results looked like, with names, numbers, time frames.

**Ground in specifics**: Ask of every sentence: "Could this fit any topic?" If yes, it needs grounding. Replace "a busy cafe" with the name of the cafe, the specific thing on the menu, the particular way the barista mispronounced your name.

**Inject honest opinion**: State what you actually think. Take a position. The reader wants to know what *you* believe, not what "many experts" believe.

### The Final Check

**Read aloud.** This is repeatedly cited as the single most effective technique across all sources. When you stumble, run out of breath, or something feels awkward in your mouth, that's where the prose needs work.

Final checklist:
1. Can you explain the argument order aloud naturally?
2. Are all claims traceable to sources you recognize?
3. Does the tone match how you or your team actually writes?
4. Would you be embarrassed if someone knew AI helped? If yes, more editing needed.

## Voice Development

In the AI era, distinctive voice is the core differentiator. It cannot be faked by editing AI output -- it must exist before AI enters the workflow.

### How to Develop Voice

**Consistent practice with stakes.** Ann Handley honed her voice by publishing a newsletter every other week without breaking the chain. Over years, her voice evolved to be "more loose, fun to read, and accessible." Practice is the teacher -- but only if you're writing for real readers, not just doing exercises.

**Audit your voice.** After re-reading your work, list adjectives that define your voice (heavy, aggressive, tentative, playful). Then identify the specific evidence in your writing that led to those conclusions. This makes voice conscious and developable rather than mystical. (Roy Peter Clark)

**Particularization.** Move from mere concept (tree, forest) into specific descriptions that disassemble the thing and cause a new, more intense perception. Through specificity in revision, prose becomes less hyperbolic, less sentimental, less misleading. (George Saunders)

**Sentence-level attention.** "Good writing is just one strong sentence after another" and "flow is something the reader experiences, not the writer." Feel the space between sentences. Each sentence must be able to stand on its own. (Verlyn Klinkenborg)

**Use AI as a mirror.** Use AI to summarize your draft or generate variations -- not to use the output, but to illuminate your own voice through the contrast. When AI writes something and you instinctively reject it, that rejection tells you something specific about your preferences and voice. (CRAFT Literary)

**The ladder of abstraction.** Move deliberately between specific examples (a particular person, a particular moment) and higher-level meanings. The movement between these levels is where insight and voice emerge. (Roy Peter Clark)

## Seven Craft Fundamentals AI Structurally Cannot Produce

These aren't bugs to be fixed in future models -- they're structural limitations of statistical text generation. Each represents an area where human writers can create unbridgeable distance from AI output.

### 1. Showing vs. Telling

AI defaults to summarizing emotions ("serene and tranquil") rather than rendering specific sensory details that let readers experience the emotion. When asked to describe a pond, AI tells you it's peaceful; a skilled writer shows the dragonfly hovering over still water, the way light fractures at the edges.

**Technique**: Engage physically with the world you're describing. Use concrete sensory detail. Let details speak for themselves.

### 2. Specificity from Lived Experience

AI produces "gentle breeze" and "blooming flowers" -- the statistically most probable descriptions. Human specificity comes from observation nobody else has made. Replace "improves results" with exactly what the results were. Replace "a restaurant" with the specific place, the specific dish, the specific thing that happened there.

### 3. Strategic Omission and Silence

AI tends toward completeness, explanation, closure. But resonant writing often lives in what's left unsaid -- "the pause before the difficult admission, the detail that reveals character through absence, the ending that trusts readers to fill the meaningful silence." In dialogue, a character dodging a question reveals more than any direct statement. AI can't generate productive silence because it's trained to produce text, not withhold it.

### 4. Rhythm Variation for Emotional Effect

AI produces sentences of similar length and structure. Everything reads smoothly but nothing stands out. Human writers use rhythm deliberately.

For building tension: start with moderate sentences and progressively shorten them as stakes rise.
For emphasis: drop a short sentence after several long ones.
The contrast creates impact.

Like that.

### 5. Deliberate Rule-Breaking

AI won't "deliberately choose the wrong word because it sounds better, or let a sentence fragment hang in space because the incompleteness is the point." Human writers know when grammar serves emotion over correctness. Fragment. For emphasis. Because sometimes a complete sentence would kill the moment.

### 6. Humor

A Google DeepMind study with 20 professional comedians found AI "struggled to produce material that was original, stimulating, or -- crucially -- funny." The fundamental issue: humor requires authentic vulnerability, cultural boundary-breaking, personal experience, and comic timing. Researchers classify humor as an "AI-complete problem." True comedy comes from "experience and vibes, not an algorithm."

### 7. Genuine Insight (The "So What?")

AI provides summaries and information; humans provide analysis. The gap: "deepening your analysis means pushing your thinking further, developing a more insightful and interesting answer to the 'so what?' question." Once you have an observation, keep asking "Why?" iteratively. Data shows the "what" -- insight tells you the "why."

## Professional Hybrid Workflows

An academic study of creative writers integrating AI (arXiv, Nov 2024) found that professionals cluster along a spectrum but all share one constant: heavy human revision.

### Named Professional Approaches

- **Farhad Manjoo** (former NYT columnist): Uses AI for "wordfinding" -- brainstorming conversations before writing, then as a "first reader" for criticism after drafting. The writing itself remains human.
- **Sarah Rose Siskind** (comedy writer): AI for researching joke setups, never for punchlines -- the creative payload stays human.
- **Stew Fortier** (writer/founder): "Reverse interviewing" -- having AI ask questions to clarify his own thinking before writing.

### The Creative Writer Spectrum

From the arXiv academic study:
- **Conservative**: AI for research and feedback only -- prose remains entirely human
- **Iterative**: Sentence-level AI assistance with careful revision of every word
- **Structural**: AI generates scenes/chapters, writer performs heavy revision

One participant captured the evaluation standard: "I can immediately evaluate whether that's a sentence I have the ability to write."

### The Key Principle

"Ruthlessly rewrite anything that feels too smooth, too expected, too safe." Preserve space for the difficult parts of writing -- the struggle to find the right word -- because over-reliance on AI bypasses the organic development of ideas that deepens both the writing and the writer.

## What Editors Look For

### What Gets Accepted

- Distinctive voice that could not have been written by anyone else
- Subtext and layers -- meaning beneath the surface
- Specificity grounded in real experience or genuine expertise
- Emotional truth and vulnerability
- Intentional craft choices (including deliberate imperfection)
- Surprise -- unexpected turns in language, structure, or insight
- The sense that the writer has something at stake

### What Triggers Rejection

- Uniform sentence length and structure
- Generic language that could apply to any topic
- Absence of subtext or emotional layers
- Over-smooth, over-safe prose without distinctive personality
- Telling without showing
- Predictable patterns and stock phrases

### Editor Perspectives

**Neil Clarke (Clarkesworld Magazine)**: AI-generated submissions are "bad in ways that no human has been bad before." Even polished hybrid works display recognizable hallmarks. "A good story works on multiple levels, and an AI story doesn't."

**Tiffany Yates Martin (developmental editor)**: AI feedback "resembles work from newer editors -- light on practical, concrete observations." Human editors provide specific actionable feedback and nuanced judgment about when to break rules for effect.

Many publications now blacklist writers caught submitting AI-generated work.
