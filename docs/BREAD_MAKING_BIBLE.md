# Part I: The Properties of Dough

Before touching flour, you need to understand what you're actually trying to control. Dough has measurable, manipulable properties. Every bread style is just a specific combination of these properties. Every technique exists to move one or more of these dials.

## Chapter 1: The Six Properties You're Always Balancing

### Strength

Strength is the dough's ability to hold its shape against gravity and internal gas pressure. Strong dough stands tall; weak dough spreads flat. Strong dough traps gas effectively; weak dough lets gas escape.

You see strength when you shape a boule and it holds its round form. You see weakness when that same boule slowly pancakes over the next hour.

Strength comes from gluten network density and organization. More gluten bonds = more strength. Better-organized bonds = more strength.

**When you want high strength:** Sandwich loaves that need to rise upward in a pan. Bagels that must hold their shape through boiling. Breads with long proof times that must resist spreading.

**When you want moderate strength:** Most artisan breads. Pizza that needs some structure but shouldn't fight you during stretching.

**When you want low strength:** Focaccia that spreads into a pan. Ciabatta that relies on the pan for shape.

### Extensibility

Extensibility is the dough's willingness to stretch without tearing. Extensible dough flows. You pull it, and it goes where you want. It doesn't fight back.

You feel extensibility when stretching pizza dough over your knuckles - good extensibility means the dough drapes and thins willingly. Poor extensibility means it tears or refuses to stretch.

Extensibility comes from relaxed gluten and sufficient hydration. The gluten proteins need to slide past each other rather than grip tightly. Gliadin, one of the two main gluten proteins, is the primary contributor to extensibility.

**When you want high extensibility:** Pizza (must stretch thin). Croissants (must roll without springing back). Ciabatta (needs to expand dramatically in oven).

**When you want moderate extensibility:** Most breads benefit from balance.

**When you want low extensibility:** Rarely. Even structured breads need some give.

### Elasticity (The Snap-Back)

Elasticity is the dough's tendency to return to its original shape after being stretched. It's the rubber-band quality. You stretch, you release, it snaps back.

Elasticity comes primarily from glutenin, the other main gluten protein. Glutenin provides both strength AND elasticity through disulfide bonds that form the structural backbone of gluten. This is why you can't truly have high strength with low elasticity - they come from the same protein.

Elasticity and extensibility are in tension. High elasticity fights extensibility. A very elastic dough resists stretching; it wants to stay where it was.

**When you want high elasticity:** Bagels (chewy bite). Breads where you want dense, tight crumb.

**When you want low elasticity:** Pizza (needs to stay stretched). Laminated doughs (layers must stay separated).

### The Strength-Extensibility-Elasticity Triangle

These three properties interact constantly:

- **Strength without extensibility** = dough that holds shape but tears when manipulated
- **Extensibility without strength** = dough that stretches but won't hold any shape
- **High elasticity** = fights extensibility (won't stretch easily) and typically comes with strength

The goal is almost never to maximize one property. It's to find the right balance for your bread. For example, what we call "low elasticity" in pizza really means "balanced toward extensibility" - you still need some structure.

### Fermentation Level

Fermentation level describes how far the yeast and bacteria have progressed in their work. This affects:

- **Gas production:** More fermentation = more bubbles = more potential rise
- **Gluten condition:** Fermentation acids have complex effects (see below)
- **Flavor complexity:** Longer fermentation = more flavor compounds
- **Sugar availability:** Yeast consumes sugars; over-fermented dough has less sugar for browning

**The acid effect on gluten is dual-phase, not simply "strengthening":**

- **Moderate acidity (pH 4.5-5.0):** Initially strengthens gluten by tightening protein bonds and enabling more disulfide bond formation. This is why preferments improve dough strength.
- **Excessive acidity (pH below 4.0):** Activates proteolytic enzymes that break down gluten proteins. Extended fermentation at low pH leads to net weakening.

This explains why preferments strengthen dough while over-fermentation weakens it - it's all about how far fermentation progresses.

Fermentation level is time-dependent but not time-determined. Temperature, yeast quantity, and dough composition all affect how fast you reach any given level.

**Under-fermented:** Dense, bland, poor oven spring, tight crumb
**Properly fermented:** Open crumb, complex flavor, good spring
**Over-fermented:** Slack dough, sour/alcoholic smell, collapse risk, pale crust

### Hydration Feel

Hydration describes how wet or dry the dough is, expressed as water weight ÷ flour weight. But the *feel* of hydration depends on more than just water percentage:

- Protein content affects water absorption (high protein flour absorbs more)
- Whole grains absorb more water over time
- Salt tightens the dough, making it feel drier
- Fermentation changes hydration feel (acids soften gluten)

A 70% hydration dough with bread flour feels different than 70% with all-purpose. The number is a starting point, not a guarantee.

**Low hydration (55-62%):** Easy to handle, shapes cleanly, tighter crumb, drier eating
**Medium hydration (63-70%):** Balanced handling and crumb, most versatile
**High hydration (71-80%+):** Sticky, requires specialized handling, open crumb, moist eating

### Flavor Profile

Flavor develops through fermentation (yeast and bacterial byproducts), Maillard reaction (crust browning), and caramelization. The levers:

- **Fermentation time:** Longer = more complex
- **Fermentation temperature:** Warmer = milder acids; cooler = sharper acids
- **Preferments:** Add depth and complexity
- **Crust development:** Browning creates hundreds of flavor compounds
- **Flour type:** Whole grains add nuttiness; refined flours are neutral

## Chapter 2: What Makes Each Bread Style Great

Now that you understand the properties, here's what each major style optimizes for:

### Neapolitan Pizza

**The goal:** Thin, extensible center that chars in spots. Puffy, airy cornicione (rim) with large irregular bubbles. Soft, pliable texture that folds without cracking. Subtle fermented flavor, not sour.

**The property profile:**

- High extensibility (stretches paper-thin without tearing)
- Moderate strength (holds shape but doesn't fight)
- Low elasticity (stays stretched, doesn't snap back)
- Well-fermented but not over-fermented (flavor without excessive acid)
- Moderate hydration (60-65% traditional, higher for home ovens)

### Pita

**The goal:** Complete pocket formation through steam puff. Soft, pliable exterior. Interior with visible webbing and large bubbles, similar to pizza cornicione structure. Tears easily for scooping.

**The property profile:**

- Moderate extensibility (must roll thin and even)
- Moderate strength (enough structure to trap steam and puff)
- Low-medium elasticity (shouldn't fight rolling)
- Moderate fermentation (some flavor, but not tangy)
- Lower hydration (55-60%) for easy rolling

### Baguette

**The goal:** Crispy, shattering crust. Open, irregular crumb with mix of hole sizes. Creamy interior. Complex wheaty-sweet flavor with mild tang.

**The property profile:**

- Balanced strength and extensibility
- Moderate elasticity
- Well-developed fermentation (preferment typical)
- Medium-high hydration (68-75%)

### Sandwich Bread

**The goal:** Even, tight crumb that slices cleanly. Soft crust. Structure that holds fillings without falling apart. Mild, sweet flavor.

**The property profile:**

- High strength (must rise tall in pan, hold shape)
- Moderate extensibility
- Moderate elasticity (too much creates tough bread)
- Lower fermentation (mild flavor)
- Moderate hydration (58-65%)
- Often enriched (fat tenderizes, sugar feeds browning)

### Ciabatta

**The goal:** Extremely open, irregular crumb with large holes. Light, airy texture. Thin crisp crust. Mild flavor with slight tang.

**The property profile:**

- Very high extensibility
- Low-moderate strength (relies on pan/peel for shape)
- Low elasticity
- Well-fermented (poolish typical)
- High hydration (75-85%)

### Sourdough Boule

**The goal:** Dramatic oven spring. Ear from scoring. Open but structured crumb. Complex tangy flavor. Thick caramelized crust.

**The property profile:**

- High strength (must hold shape during long proof)
- Good extensibility (for oven spring)
- Moderate elasticity
- Extended fermentation with cold retard
- Medium-high hydration (70-78%)

# Part II: The Tools and How They Work

You have a limited set of tools to manipulate dough properties. Each tool affects multiple properties simultaneously. Mastery means understanding these cause-and-effect relationships so you can combine tools intentionally.

## Chapter 3: Flour - Your Starting Point

Flour sets your baseline. You can adjust from there, but you can't escape the flour's fundamental character.

### Protein Content

Protein percentage predicts gluten potential. More protein = more potential strength. But this relationship is straightforward only for hard wheat flours (typical American bread and all-purpose).

- **8-10% (cake/pastry flour):** Minimal gluten, tender, weak
- **10-12% (all-purpose):** Moderate gluten, versatile
- **12-14% (bread flour):** Strong gluten, good structure
- **14%+ (high-gluten flour):** Very strong, chewy

**But protein isn't everything.** Protein *quality* matters as much as quantity. The ratio of glutenin to gliadin affects whether dough tends toward strength/elasticity or extensibility.

**Hard wheat vs. soft wheat:** American flours are typically hard wheat, where protein content reliably predicts strength. European flours (especially Italian) are often soft wheat, where the protein-strength relationship breaks down. Two soft wheat flours at 12% protein can behave completely differently.

### Understanding Italian Tipo 00

Tipo 00 is often misunderstood. The "00" refers to milling fineness and extraction rate, not protein content. Tipo 00 flours range from 7% protein (for pastry) to 13%+ (for bread), depending on intended use.

**W Value:** Italian flour strength is measured by the alveograph W value - the energy needed to blow a bubble in dough until it bursts:

- W170 or less: Very weak (biscuits, waffles)
- W180-260: Medium strength (pizza, French bread, pasta)
- W280-350: Strong (long-fermented breads)
- W350+: Very strong (panettone, extended fermentation)

**P/L Ratio:** Measures the balance between tenacity (resistance) and extensibility:

- Optimal: 0.5-0.6
- Above 0.7: Resistant, tough dough
- Below 0.4: Weak, overly extensible

For serious hobbyists working with Italian flours, these metrics matter more than protein percentage.

**The practical decision:** Match protein to your target bread. Pizza wants extensibility, so tipo 00 with appropriate W value works well. Bagels want strength, so high-gluten flour helps. For most American flours, protein percentage is a reliable guide.

### Fresh Milling and Whole Grains

Whole grain flours contain bran and germ, which:

- Cut gluten strands physically (bran particles are sharp - medium-fine ~300µm works best)
- Add enzymes that break down gluten over time
- Absorb water slowly (hydration feels different over time)
- Ferment faster (more wild yeast and bacteria, more food)

**Fresh-milled flour** is more enzymatically active and ferments faster. However, there's a "green flour" window: flour used within 8 hours of milling is fine, but flour a few days old can be problematic until it ages 2-3 weeks and oxidizes/stabilizes.

**The tool effect:** Whole grains reduce effective strength and require adjusted technique (longer autolyse, gentler handling, often lower hydration initially that increases as bran hydrates).

-----

## Chapter 4: Salt - More Than Flavor

Salt is typically 1.8-2.2% of flour weight, but its effects extend far beyond seasoning.

### What Salt Does

1. **Strengthens gluten:** Salt tightens gluten strands and stabilizes the protein network through ionic interactions. Dough without salt is weak and sticky.

2. **Controls fermentation:** Salt slows yeast activity through osmosis, preventing wild over-fermentation. This gives you more control over timing.

3. **Enhances crust color:** By slowing fermentation, salt leaves residual sugars for Maillard browning. Salt-free bread bakes pale.

4. **Amplifies flavor:** Salt doesn't just add saltiness - it enhances the wheat's natural sweetness and nutty notes.

5. **Preserves carotenoids:** Salt delays dough oxidation, preserving flavor compounds that would otherwise break down.

### Timing and Amount

**Too little salt:** Bland taste, sticky dough, weak gluten, flat spreading loaves, unpredictable fermentation.

**Too much salt:** Inhibits yeast excessively, unpleasantly salty, dense texture.

**When to add:** Traditional autolyse excludes salt to maximize extensibility. Otherwise, add at the start of mixing to get full oxidation-delay benefits.

## Chapter 5: Hydration - The Texture Lever

Water percentage directly shapes how your dough handles and what crumb you get.

### How Hydration Affects Properties

|Hydration|Strength       |Extensibility|Handling                  |Crumb            |
|---------|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
|55-60%   |Easier to build|Lower        |Easy                      |Tight, even      |
|63-68%   |Moderate       |Moderate     |Moderate                  |Moderate openness|
|70-75%   |Harder to build|Higher       |Difficult                 |Open, irregular  |
|78%+     |Very hard      |Very high    |Requires special technique|Very open        |

**The mechanism:** Water lubricates gluten proteins, allowing them to slide and extend. More water = more slip = more extensibility. But more water also means gluten bonds are more spread out and harder to organize = harder to build strength.

### The High-Hydration Tradeoff

High hydration gives you extensibility and open crumb, but you sacrifice easy handling. You can't knead wet dough traditionally - you must use stretch-and-folds, coil folds, or lamination.

**The practical decision:** Start at 65% and increase by 2-3% as your skills develop. Don't chase high hydration for its own sake - chase the crumb and texture you want.

-----

## Chapter 6: Mixing and Kneading - Building the Network

Mechanical action aligns and connects gluten proteins. More mixing = more development = more strength (up to a point).

### The Development Spectrum

**Undermixed:** Shaggy, tears easily, no windowpane. Weak, won't hold shape.

**Short mix:** Comes together but rough. Some strength, relies on time to finish development.

**Medium mix:** Smooth, slightly tacky, passes windowpane with thick membrane. Good balance.

**Full mix:** Very smooth, elastic, strong windowpane. Maximum strength from mixing alone.

**Overmixed:** Slack, sticky, tears - gluten bonds have broken. Rare by hand, possible with stand mixer.

### The Windowpane Test

To assess gluten development:

1. Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough
2. Let it rest 5 minutes (allows gluten to relax for accurate test)
3. Gently stretch a section of dough
4. Try to stretch thin enough to see light through it

**Pass:** Can stretch dough thin enough to see light without tearing → gluten well-developed
**Fail:** Dough tears almost immediately → needs more mixing or time

**When to use:** Essential for enriched doughs (brioche, panettone) where fat slows development. Less critical for long-fermented breads where time develops gluten naturally.

### The Tool Effect

Mixing primarily builds **strength** and **elasticity**. It does not build extensibility - in fact, aggressive mixing can reduce extensibility by organizing gluten too tightly.

**The practical decision:** For extensible doughs (pizza, ciabatta), mix less and rely on time. For strong doughs (bagels, sandwich bread), mix more thoroughly.

-----

## Chapter 7: Autolyse - Free Gluten Development

Autolyse means mixing just flour and water, then resting before adding other ingredients.

### What Happens During Autolyse

1. **Flour hydrates fully** - water penetrates every starch granule and protein
2. **Gluten begins forming passively** - proteins bond without mechanical input
3. **Enzymes activate** - amylase breaks starch into sugar; protease begins (slowly) relaxing proteins
4. **Extensibility increases** - well-hydrated, relaxed gluten stretches more easily

### The Tool Effect on Properties

|Property       |Effect of Autolyse                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
|Strength       |Moderate increase (passive gluten development)|
|Extensibility  |Significant increase (hydration + relaxation) |
|Elasticity     |Decrease (relaxed gluten is less snappy)      |
|Required mixing|Decrease (development happens during rest)    |

### Duration Decisions

- **20-30 minutes:** Noticeable improvement, minimal commitment
- **1-2 hours:** Significant extensibility gain, good for pizza
- **4+ hours:** Maximum extensibility, but enzyme activity may weaken gluten excessively

### Variations

**With or without salt?** Salt tightens gluten and slows enzyme activity. Traditional autolyse excludes salt. Including salt gives you more control (less enzyme breakdown) but less extensibility gain.

**With or without yeast/starter?** Traditional autolyse excludes leavening. Including levain means fermentation starts during autolyse - this can work but changes the timeline.

**The practical decision:** For pizza and high-extensibility needs, use longer autolyse (1-2 hours) without salt. For standard bread, 30-60 minutes with or without salt both work well. For whole grains, extend to 2-4 hours to soften bran.

-----

## Chapter 8: Desired Dough Temperature - The Control Variable

Temperature is the single most important variable for consistent results. A 2°C difference can change fermentation rate by 25%, throwing off all your timing.

### Why DDT Matters

Desired Dough Temperature (DDT) is your target temperature after mixing. It determines fermentation speed and predictability.

**Standard targets:**
- Artisan bread: 75-79°F (24-26°C)
- Quick-rise breads: 80-85°F (27-29°C)
- Enriched doughs: 75-77°F (24-25°C)

### The DDT Formula

Calculate what water temperature you need to hit your target:

**Basic formula:**
```
Water temp = (DDT × 3) - Room temp - Flour temp - Friction factor
```

**With preferment:**
```
Water temp = (DDT × 4) - Room temp - Flour temp - Preferment temp - Friction factor
```

**Friction factor** is heat generated by mixing:
- Stand mixer: 22-24°F
- Hand mixing: 6-8°F
- Adjust based on your equipment and mixing intensity

### Practical Application

If you want 76°F dough, and your kitchen is 70°F, flour is 68°F, and friction adds 22°F:

Water temp = (76 × 3) - 70 - 68 - 22 = 228 - 160 = 68°F

Use a thermometer until you develop intuition. Temperature control separates consistent bakers from frustrated ones.

## Chapter 9: Fermentation Time - The Flavor and Structure Engine

Time is your most powerful tool. Extended fermentation simultaneously:

- Develops flavor (yeast byproducts, bacterial acids)
- Continues gluten development (bonds continue forming)
- Eventually weakens gluten (acids break bonds)
- Produces gas (yeast metabolism)

### The Fermentation Arc

**Early stage (0-30% rise):**

- Gas production beginning
- Gluten still strengthening
- Minimal flavor development
- Dough tight, elastic

**Middle stage (30-75% rise):**

- Active gas production
- Gluten at peak strength, beginning to relax
- Flavor developing
- Dough becoming more extensible

**Late stage (75-100%+ rise):**

- Gas production slowing (yeast running out of food)
- Gluten weakening from acid exposure
- Maximum flavor complexity
- Dough very extensible, potentially slack

**Over-fermented:**

- Gas escaping faster than produced
- Gluten broken down
- Alcoholic/very sour smell
- Dough slack, sticky, won't hold shape

### The Tool Effect on Properties

|Property             |Effect of Longer Fermentation         |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Strength             |Increases, then decreases (bell curve)|
|Extensibility        |Increases continuously                |
|Flavor               |Increases in complexity               |
|Oven spring potential|Increases, then decreases (bell curve)|

**The practical decision:** Watch your dough, not the clock. Learn to recognize the 50-75% rise stage for most breads. Under-ferment slightly for maximum oven spring; ferment fully for maximum flavor.

-----

## Chapter 10: Fermentation Temperature - The Speed Dial

Temperature controls fermentation rate. Everything that happens during fermentation happens faster when warm, slower when cold.

### The Time-Temperature Relationship

Fermentation rate roughly doubles for every 15°F (8°C) increase in temperature.

|Temperature|Relative Speed|Practical Timeline|
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
|40°F / 4°C |Very slow     |24-72 hours       |
|55°F / 13°C|Slow          |12-24 hours       |
|70°F / 21°C|Moderate      |4-8 hours         |
|78°F / 26°C|Fast          |2-4 hours         |
|85°F / 29°C|Very fast     |1-2 hours         |

### Temperature Also Affects Flavor

This is crucial: temperature doesn't just change speed, it changes what happens.

**Warmer fermentation (78-85°F):**

- Yeast more active relative to bacteria
- Lactic acid bacteria favor lactic acid production
- Result: milder, yogurt-like tang

**Cooler fermentation (65-75°F):**

- Bacteria more active relative to yeast
- Lactic acid bacteria favor acetic acid production
- Result: sharper, vinegar-like tang

**Cold fermentation (38-45°F):**

- Yeast nearly dormant (goes to sleep below 40°F)
- Some bacterial activity continues
- Enzymes continue working slowly
- Result: complex flavor development, sharper tang potential

### What Happens in the Fridge

Important: dough takes 8-12 hours to cool to fridge temperature. During this cool-down, fermentation continues actively. Even after dough reaches "hibernation" temperature, enzymes keep working - starch enzymes break down starches into sugars even while yeast sleeps.

### The Tool Effect on Properties

|Property        |Warmer                   |Cooler                   |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|Flavor          |Milder                   |More complex, tangier    |
|Timeline        |Shorter                  |Longer                   |
|Gluten condition|Weakens faster           |Stays strong longer      |
|Control         |Less (things happen fast)|More (things happen slow)|

**The practical decision:** Use temperature to fit bread into your schedule. Need bread tonight? Warm bulk ferment. Want to bake tomorrow morning? Cold retard overnight. Cold fermentation is almost always better for flavor - the only tradeoff is time.

-----

## Chapter 11: Folds During Bulk - Strength Without Kneading

Stretch-and-folds (or coil folds) during bulk fermentation build strength gently while redistributing yeast, temperature, and food.

### What Folds Actually Do

1. **Organize gluten** - aligns strands, creates structure
2. **Degas partially** - redistributes gas for even crumb
3. **Redistribute yeast** - brings yeast to fresh food supply
4. **Equalize temperature** - prevents hot/cold spots
5. **Build strength** - each fold adds tension to the gluten network

### How Fold Quantity Affects Properties

|Folds|Strength                       |Extensibility|Crumb               |
|-----|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|
|0-1  |Low                            |High         |Very open, irregular|
|2-3  |Moderate                       |Moderate-high|Open                |
|4-6  |High                           |Moderate     |More even           |
|7+   |Very high (diminishing returns)|Lower        |Even, tighter       |

### Timing and Technique

**Early folds (first 1-2 hours):** Build most strength. Gluten is still developing and responds well.

**Later folds (after 2+ hours):** Gentler effect. Gluten is more developed and more fragile from acid exposure.

**Fold intensity:** Aggressive stretching builds more strength but can tear over-fermented dough. Gentle coil folds are safer for long fermentation.

**The practical decision:** For high-extensibility doughs (pizza, ciabatta), use 1-2 gentle folds. For structured doughs (sourdough boule), use 4-6 folds in the first 2 hours. If your dough is spreading flat, add more folds. If it's too tight and fighting you, use fewer folds.

-----

## Chapter 12: Preferments - Flavor and Texture Multipliers

A preferment is a portion of dough fermented before the main mix. It adds fermentation benefits without requiring a long final timeline.

### What All Preferments Share

- Extended fermentation develops flavor
- Organic acids condition gluten (more extensibility)
- Some gluten development happens
- Yeast multiplies (more leavening power)

### The Preferment Spectrum

|Preferment    |Hydration|Character                 |Effect on Final Dough            |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Biga          |50-60%   |Stiff, slow, nutty/sharp  |More strength, more flavor depth |
|Poolish       |100%     |Liquid, fast, mild/buttery|More extensibility, milder tang  |
|Pâte fermentée|Varies   |Old dough, contains salt  |Moderate effect, very convenient |
|Levain        |Varies   |Sourdough, complex        |Depends on hydration and ripeness|

### Why Stiffness Matters

**Stiff preferments (biga):**

- Ferment more slowly
- Develop more acetic acid (sharper)
- Retain more gluten strength
- Add structure to final dough

**Wet preferments (poolish):**

- Ferment more quickly
- Develop more lactic acid (milder)
- Gluten more relaxed/broken down
- Add extensibility to final dough

### Over-Ripening Risk

Don't let preferments ferment too long. An over-ripe preferment - one that has collapsed and sat for extended periods - will have killed the gluten and produce weak, hard-to-handle dough. Use preferments at or just past their peak.

### Percentage of Prefermented Flour

How much of your total flour goes through preferment? This dial controls intensity:

|% Prefermented|Effect                                                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|10-15%        |Subtle flavor improvement                                           |
|20-30%        |Noticeable complexity                                               |
|40-50%        |Significant flavor and texture change                               |
|60%+          |Dominant preferment character, potentially too much gluten breakdown|

### The Tool Effect on Properties

|Property          |Poolish Effect            |Biga Effect               |
|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|Strength          |Decreases                 |Increases                 |
|Extensibility     |Increases                 |Moderate increase         |
|Flavor            |Milder complexity         |Sharper complexity        |
|Fermentation speed|Faster (more active yeast)|Faster (more active yeast)|

**The practical decision:** Use poolish when you want extensibility and mild flavor (baguettes, pizza). Use biga when you want structure and depth (ciabatta, rustic breads). Use pâte fermentée when you want convenience (just save dough). Start at 20-30% prefermented flour.

-----

## Chapter 13: Cold Retard - Time Shifting and Flavor Building

Cold retard means refrigerating dough during bulk or proof. It's perhaps the highest-value technique for home bakers.

### What Cold Does

1. **Slows fermentation dramatically** - buys you 12-72 hours of flexibility
2. **Favors flavor development** - enzymes and bacteria work while yeast sleeps
3. **Develops sharper tang** - acetic acid production continues
4. **Improves handling** - cold dough shapes and scores more easily
5. **Preserves gluten strength** - less acid exposure per unit of fermentation

### When to Cold Retard

**After bulk, before shaping (cold bulk):**

- More flavor development
- Requires shaping cold dough (harder)
- Good for slack doughs that benefit from firming up

**After shaping, before baking (cold proof):**

- Easier workflow (shape while dough is warm)
- Shape holds better during cold proof
- Can bake directly from fridge

### Duration Effects

|Duration   |Flavor                   |Handling        |Notes                     |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
|8-16 hours |Moderate improvement     |Good            |Minimum useful retard     |
|24-48 hours|Significant complexity   |Excellent       |Sweet spot for most breads|
|48-72 hours|Peak complexity          |Excellent       |Pizza benefits especially |
|72+ hours  |Risk of over-fermentation|May become slack|Monitor carefully         |

### The Tool Effect on Properties

|Property     |Cold Retard Effect                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
|Flavor       |Significantly more complex                    |
|Strength     |Preserved longer                              |
|Extensibility|Increases over time                           |
|Oven spring  |Often improved (cold dough, hot oven contrast)|
|Crust color  |Often improved (more residual sugars)         |

**The practical decision:** Cold retard almost everything. The only reason not to is time pressure. 24-48 hours is the sweet spot. For pizza, 48-72 hours is ideal.

## Chapter 14: Shaping - Building Surface Tension

Shaping organizes dough for its final rise and creates the surface tension that enables upward expansion.

### Pre-Shape and Bench Rest

Why two shaping steps?

1. **Pre-shape** loosely organizes dough and begins building tension
2. **Bench rest (10-45 min)** allows gluten to relax
3. **Final shape** builds maximum tension without tearing

**Pre-shaping technique:** Form a loosely rounded shape with moderate tension. Stop when the top is smooth without creases. Don't over-tighten or the surface will tear. Use a bench knife with push-forward and U-turn motion.

**Bench rest duration:**
- Tighter pre-shape = longer rest needed (30-45 min)
- Looser pre-shape = shorter rest (10-20 min)
- Judge by state: dough should relax outward but not flatten to pancake

Skipping bench rest means fighting tight dough that tears instead of stretching.

### What Shaping Does

1. **Creates taut outer skin** - traps gas, directs expansion upward
2. **Organizes internal structure** - aligns gluten for even crumb
3. **Degasses partially** - redistributes gas, size affects final crumb
4. **Sets final form** - boule, batard, baguette, etc.

### Tension vs. Over-tightening

**Proper tension:** Smooth surface, slight resistance when you poke, springs back slowly, no visible tears

**Over-tightened:** Tearing at seams, very tight/resistant surface, dough fighting you, may have visible stress marks

**Under-tensioned:** Dough spreading, soft/slack surface, won't hold shape

### The Tool Effect on Properties

Shaping doesn't change fundamental properties - it organizes what you have:

- Builds tension (not strength - tension is temporary structural arrangement)
- Gentle shaping preserves gas for open crumb
- Aggressive shaping degasses for even crumb

**The practical decision:** Let the dough rest between shapes. If it tears, wait longer. If it won't hold shape, build more strength earlier (more folds, longer bulk, stronger flour).

## Chapter 15: Reading Your Dough - Proofing Indicators

Knowing when dough is ready is critical. Under- or over-proofed dough produces poor results regardless of other factors.

### The Poke Test

Press dough gently with a floured or oiled finger about 1/2 to 1 inch deep:

- **Springs back immediately:** Under-proofed. Needs more time.
- **Springs back slowly (about 10 seconds), fills about halfway:** Ready for most styles. Best oven spring.
- **Springs back very slowly, leaves noticeable indentation:** Fully proofed. Good crumb, moderate spring.
- **Doesn't spring back at all:** Over-proofed. Bake immediately or dough may collapse.

### Limitations of the Poke Test

**Cold dough gives false readings.** Cold makes dough tighter and more elastic regardless of actual proof level. If proofing in the fridge, use time (typically 10+ hours) plus visual cues rather than poke test.

### Visual Cues

During bulk fermentation:
- **Rising but dough feels tight:** Needs more folds to relax, or more time
- **Domed, jiggles, edges rounded:** Fermentation progressing well
- **Spreading flat, very slack:** Either very high hydration (normal) or over-fermented (problem)
- **Smells alcoholic or very sour:** Over-fermented

During final proof:
- **Puffy, light, risen 75-80% of expected height:** Ready
- **Still dense, hasn't risen much:** Needs more time
- **Extremely aerated, feels fragile:** Over-proofed

### Internal Temperature for Doneness

When is bread fully baked?
- Standard loaves: 200-210°F (93-99°C) internal
- High-hydration loaves: 205°F+ (96°C+) to ensure excess moisture is gone
- Enriched breads: 185-190°F (85-88°C)

Use a probe thermometer. This is more reliable than tapping for "hollow sound."

-----

## Chapter 16: Scoring - Controlling the Expansion

Scoring (slashing) controls where and how bread expands in the oven. Without proper scoring, bread bursts unpredictably.

### Why Score

1. **Directs expansion:** Scores create weak points where dough preferentially expands
2. **Controls shape:** Score placement determines final loaf shape
3. **Creates ears:** Angled cuts produce the dramatic "ear" on artisan loaves
4. **Aesthetic patterns:** Decorative scoring adds visual appeal

### Scoring Technique

**Depth:**
- Main structural cuts: 1/4" to 1/2" deep
- Decorative cuts: 1/8" to 1/4" deep

**Angle:**
- 45° angle (blade nearly parallel to surface): Creates "ears"
- 90° angle (blade perpendicular): Creates "belly" expansion

**Speed:**
- Should take 1/2 to 4 seconds per cut
- Faster is better - hesitation drags and tears

**Timing:**
- Score immediately before baking, never before final proof
- Cold dough from refrigerator scores best (firms up the surface)

### Tools

**Lame (bread razor):**
- Curved lame for batards and ear formation
- Straight lame for boules
- Replace blade as soon as it drags

**Sharp knife:** Not ideal but works in a pinch. Must be very sharp.

**The practical decision:** For beginners, one simple slash down the center of a boule works fine. Add complexity as you gain confidence. Prioritize sharp blade and speed over intricate patterns.

## Chapter 17: The Oven Environment - The Final Transformation

Heat transforms dough into bread through several simultaneous processes.

### Oven Spring

The dramatic rise in the first 10-15 minutes comes from:

- CO2 expanding in heat
- Water converting to steam
- Yeast's final burst of activity before dying at 140°F
- Gluten stretching one last time before setting

**Maximizing spring requires:**

- Slightly under-proofed dough (still has expansion capacity)
- High initial heat (rapid gas expansion)
- Steam (keeps crust flexible)
- Proper scoring (directs expansion)
- Cold dough from fridge (maximum temperature differential)

### Oven Spring Temperature Strategy

**NOT hotter is always better.** Too-high heat can set the crust before full expansion.

- **Professional method:** Start at 450°F (230°C) for 15 min, reduce to 375°F (190°C) to finish
- **Dutch oven:** Preheat to 500°F, bake at 450°F with lid on 25-30 min, lid off 20-25 min
- **Pizza steel/stone:** Maximum heat your oven allows

### Steam

Steam in early baking:

- Keeps crust flexible (allows expansion)
- Gelatinizes surface starch (creates gloss)
- Enables score opening (the "ear")
- Improves browning (Maillard reaction needs moisture initially)

**Timing:**
- Maintain steam for first 10-20 minutes
- Yeasted breads: ~10 minutes
- Sourdough: ~20 minutes
- Vent when crust starts visible browning (typically 12-15 min)

**After 15-20 minutes:** Remove steam/lid for crust development. Dry heat creates crisp crust.

### Steam Methods for Home Ovens

**Dutch oven (most effective):** Traps natural dough moisture in enclosed chamber. Chad Robertson (Tartine) recommends this as the best solution for home ovens that can't maintain steam.

**Lava rocks/cast iron pan:** Preheat a pan with lava rocks on bottom rack. Pour boiling water or add ice when loading bread.

**Spray bottle (least effective):** Loses too much oven heat, inconsistent results.

**Safety note:** Never spray glass door or oven light - can shatter from thermal shock.

### Baking Vessels Compared

|Vessel                    |Pros                                    |Cons                              |Best For                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
|Dutch oven                |Superior steam, even heat, easiest      |Limits size/shape, one loaf only  |Boules, batards, beginners|
|Baking stone/steel        |Multiple loaves, all shapes, visual feedback|Requires steam system, inferior results alone|Baguettes, multiple loaves|
|Combo cooker (shallow base)|Easier scoring/loading than Dutch oven  |Same limitations                  |Same as Dutch oven        |

### Heat Sources and Effects

|Heat Source               |Effect                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|Bottom heat (stone/steel) |Drives oven spring, sets bottom crust|
|Top heat (radiant/broiler)|Browns top, chars spots              |
|Enclosed (Dutch oven)     |Traps steam, even heat               |
|Convection                |Even browning, faster drying         |

### Home Oven vs. Pizza Oven

|Factor       |Home Oven (500°F)          |Pizza Oven (800°F+)        |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|Bake time    |6-12 minutes               |60-90 seconds              |
|Crust        |Drier, more even           |Charred spots, softer      |
|Interior     |More dried out             |More moist                 |
|Optimal dough|Higher hydration, oil helps|Traditional lower hydration|

**The practical decision:** Match dough to your oven. Home pizza benefits from higher hydration (65-70%) and small amounts of oil. Wood-fired pizza works best with traditional 60-62% hydration. For bread, Dutch oven solves the home steam problem completely.

# Part III: Combining Tools for Specific Outcomes

Now you understand properties and tools. Here's how to think about combining them.

## Chapter 18: The Decision Framework

### Start With the End

What bread do you want? Define the properties:

- How open should the crumb be?
- How strong does the structure need to be?
- What flavor profile - mild, tangy, complex?
- What crust - thin/crisp, thick/chewy, soft?
- What handling do you want - easy, moderate, challenging?

### Work Backward to Tools

**Example: Neapolitan-style pizza for home oven**

Target properties:

- High extensibility (must stretch thin)
- Moderate strength (hold shape, not fight back)
- Low elasticity (stay stretched)
- Complex flavor (long fermentation)
- Soft, slightly charred crust

Tool selection:

- Flour: Tipo 00 or AP (extensible protein character)
- Hydration: 65-68% (higher than traditional for longer home oven bake)
- Mixing: Brief mix only, rely on time
- Autolyse: 1-2 hours (maximize extensibility)
- Fermentation: 24-72 hour cold retard (flavor, extensibility)
- Folds: 2-3 gentle folds max (don't overbuild strength)
- Oil: 2% (helps with home oven browning and tenderness)
- Oven: Baking steel, maximum heat, upper third of oven

**Example: Pita with pocket and airy interior**

Target properties:

- Moderate extensibility (must roll thin evenly)
- Moderate strength (trap steam for puff)
- Lower elasticity (shouldn't fight rolling)
- Mild flavor (short fermentation is fine)
- Soft, pliable texture

Tool selection:

- Flour: AP or bread flour (moderate protein)
- Hydration: 58-62% (easy rolling)
- Mixing: Medium development (need structure for puff)
- Autolyse: 30-60 minutes (improve rollability)
- Fermentation: 1-2 hours room temp (don't need complexity)
- Folds: 1-2 (don't overbuild)
- Oil: 2-3% (tenderness)
- Oven: Blazing hot surface (500°F+ stone/steel or stovetop cast iron)

**Example: Tangy sourdough boule**

Target properties:

- High strength (tall rise, holds shape)
- Moderate extensibility (oven spring, scoring)
- Complex tangy flavor
- Open but structured crumb
- Thick caramelized crust

Tool selection:

- Flour: Bread flour, possibly 10-20% whole grain
- Hydration: 72-78% (open crumb)
- Mixing: Medium, finish development with folds
- Autolyse: 30-60 minutes
- Levain: 20-25% prefermented flour, used at peak (not overripe)
- Fermentation: 4-6 hour bulk + 12-24 hour cold proof
- Folds: 4-6 in first 2 hours (build strength)
- Oven: Dutch oven, 500°F, lid on 25 min, lid off 20-25 min

## Chapter 20: Practical Scheduling

Bread fits into your life, not the other way around. Cold fermentation is the key.

### The Overnight Schedule (Most Common)

**Evening (30 min active):**
1. Mix dough, hit target DDT
2. Bulk ferment at room temp 2-4 hours with folds
3. Shape
4. Refrigerate overnight

**Morning (10 min active):**
1. Preheat oven with Dutch oven inside
2. Score cold dough (easier when cold)
3. Bake

### The Weekend Schedule (Maximum Flavor)

**Friday evening:** Mix and bulk ferment 2-3 hours
**Friday night:** Shape and refrigerate
**Saturday-Sunday:** Bake anytime in 24-48 hour window

### The Workday Schedule

**Morning:** Mix dough, refrigerate immediately (cold bulk)
**Evening:** Remove, warm up 1-2 hours, shape, proof, bake

The fridge is your friend. You can move dough in and out based on your schedule. Hands-on time for most breads: under 30 minutes total.

-----

## Chapter 21: Baker's Percentages - The Universal Language

All ingredients expressed as percentage of total flour weight. Flour = 100% always.

### Why This Matters

- Scale any recipe by changing flour weight
- Compare recipes instantly
- Communicate precisely
- Adjust single variables while keeping others constant

### The Formula

```
Ingredient percentage = (ingredient weight ÷ flour weight) × 100
Ingredient weight = flour weight × (percentage ÷ 100)
```

### Reference Ranges

|Ingredient     |Typical Range|What Changing It Does                      |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
|Water          |55-85%       |Crumb openness, handling difficulty        |
|Salt           |1.8-2.5%     |Flavor, fermentation speed, gluten strength|
|Yeast (instant)|0.1-2%       |Fermentation speed                         |
|Starter        |15-30%       |Fermentation speed, sourness               |
|Oil/fat        |0-10%        |Tenderness, softness, browning             |
|Sugar          |0-10%        |Browning, tenderness, yeast food           |

### With Preferments

When using preferments, you have flour and water in multiple places. You must account for all of it:

Total flour = flour in preferment + flour in final dough
Total water = water in preferment + water in final dough
Total hydration = total water ÷ total flour

## Essential Equipment

**Non-negotiable:**
- Digital scale (precision is everything)
- Instant-read thermometer (for water, dough, and internal temp)

**High-value:**
- Dutch oven or combo cooker (solves home steam problem)
- Bench scraper (essential for high-hydration doughs)
- Bread lame or razor blades (for scoring)
- Proofing baskets/bannetons (structure during final proof)

**Nice to have:**
- Stand mixer (saves effort but not required)
- Baking steel/stone (for pizza, baguettes)
- Proofing box (precise temperature control)

## The 90/10 Summary

**The 90% that matters most:**

1. Use the right protein flour for your bread
2. Hit your target hydration
3. Control dough temperature (DDT)
4. Ferment until you see the signs, not until the clock says
5. Control temperature to control speed
6. Build strength with folds if needed
7. Don't over-proof
8. Steam for the first 15-20 minutes
9. Score properly

**The 10% for refinement:**

- Precise autolyse timing
- Preferment selection and percentage
- Exact fermentation temperatures
- Advanced shaping techniques
- Decorative scoring patterns
- W value and flour selection
- Open crumb optimization

*Understanding these principles means you never need to follow a recipe blindly again. You read a recipe and understand why each step exists. You taste a bread you love and can reverse-engineer how to make it. You encounter a problem and know which variable to adjust. That's mastery.*
